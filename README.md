# MLM
Repository for the Multilevel Modeling course 2022 @Utrecht University

## Course Description
In many situations data have a nested structure. In psychological research, for example,
employees may be nested within organizations, and in longitudinal studies repeated measurements
are nested within persons. The appropriate analysis technique for this kind of data is multilevel
modeling. In this course, we learn the theoretical basics of multilevel modeling, followed by a
number of advanced topics. The multilevel part covers the two and three level multilevel model,
analyzing longitudinal data, contextual effects and dichotomous and ordinal data using multilevel
models.

## Course Aim
This course teaches students to use statistical multilevel modeling techniques. At the end of the course
students should be able to execute multilevel analysis and interpret the results.

## Topics
- The basic two-level multilevel regression model
- The three-level MLM and MLM assumptions
- Analyzing longitudinal data using multilevel analysis
- Contextual effects
- Analyzing dichotomous and ordinal data
